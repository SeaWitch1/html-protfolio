<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Rinat Glazer, I'm currntly 30 years old<br/>
  I'm a mother of one human baby and one fur baby<br/>
  I have a degree in Nursing and worked as a nurse in a public care facility(Kupat holim) 
</p>

<p>I reacntly had an epiphany that I might not enjoy nursing as mush as I thought,<br/>
and because of that got in to Udemy to find a beginner course.<br/>
I searched and searched till I found Angela's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp">course</a>
</p>

<p>Now I hope this will give me the easy start to transition in my career</p>
